# Projet_Python_for_Data
The powerpoint is inside of this main folder.


We made the part 2 (visualization) and part 3 (modelization) into TWO different jupyter notebook.

For the api:
You should open webservice folder with a ide, and run app.py wiht ide. We made this part with Pycharm
and python 3.8 conda envirenment interpreter.
For some reason, the API codes only works on Pycharm (Original error was: DLL load failed while importing _multiarray_umath: Le module spécifié est introuvable.)
on VScode.

It works very well with a satisfaring prediction accuracy of rented bike number at each hour
